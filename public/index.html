            <div class="col-8">
                <p>It is a valid concern that Occidental is in the uncanny valley for Romance language speakers in particular. However, see this quote below</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p>The "Uncanny Valley" is much the same as what I've called the "Rube Effect": 
                                a feature of a system that makes me feel illiterate for using it. I referred to it 
                                in the post "Not-so-Great Expectations" a few weeks ago. My point was that if 
                                there is a slight resemblance between the new system and ones already 
                                known, you can accept it as coincidence and use it as a mnemonic, but if the 
                                resemblance is great, then any deviation will be perceived as an error.</p>
                    
                        <p>Thus the "Romance" aspect of Eo is fairly low, so it doesn't bother me when it 
                            does something non-Romance. But when Ia does something non-Romance, 
                            such as not having multiple negation (which Occidental does allow), it not only 
                            seems wrong, but almost deceptive: I feel set up, taken in by its Romance 
                            appearance. Because Occidental doesn't look entirely Romance (the 
                            pronoun "it," past tense in -t, "lass," "mey," etc.) I may find it annoying, 
                            perhaps, but I don't feel deceived.</p>
                    
                        <p>I once wrote that when you visit Interlingua, it answers the door in a Romance 
                            mask, ushers you inside, exchanges pleasantries, and goes to get you some 
                            tea. Then it pours the tea on your head and reverts to the mask. "Is 
                            something wrong?"</p>
                    
                        <p>When you visit Occidental, it resembles some Romance languages you've 
                            known, but it looks more like a creole of Romance and English. It almost 
                            immediately slaps you in the face, says, "I'm not Romance," and then invites 
                            you in and is a gracious host. In other words, it establishes independence 
                            early on, and you either accept it or leave. Interlingua maintains a Romance 
                            guise most of the time, only to do something really alien when you aren't 
                            expecting it.</p>
                    
                        <p>This is why I kept seeing native speakers of Romance languages trying to fix 
                            Ia: when you try something that seems odd, even though the grammar may 
                            specifically permit it, you're wrong. You cannot really say "Ille vide me," even 
                            though it's technically allowed (it is completely acceptable as "Il vide me" in 
                            Occ). </p>
