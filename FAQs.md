# What about Interlingua, Esperanto, Lingwa de Planeta, and other Auxlangs? What sets Occidental apart from the rest?

All auxlangs are made with the best of intentions and deserve respect. Out of the hundreds and even thousands of proposed projects, the ones mentioned above are some of the very few that have ever managed to achieve an active user base, and that makes them unique.

Having said that, what makes Occidental unique is the following:

- It looks like a natural language. Most people conclude it must be a dialect similar to Catalan or Occitan, spoken in the area between Spain and France. And that means that:
- It's remarkably easy to read. About one or two billion people can work their way through an Occidental text without ever having seen one before.
- However, it's still a language created to be as easy as possible. It's a language that you can learn in a few weeks and come out knowing how to read a lot of related languages like Italian and French without having studied them before. And as the next question shows, you’ll come out knowing a lot more about English too.

Some of the auxlangs above have an appearance as natural as Occidental, and others have a grammar as (and even a little bit more) regular. But no language has managed to blend a natural look and regular grammar as well as Occidental has. That's why it took its creator 30 years to put it together.

# Why should I spend time learning Occidental instead of a natural language?

Occidental can be thought of as the simplified and tidied up quintessence of the Western European languages, or rather Europe’s Greco-Roman heritage. The common vocabulary is connected but hidden, and Occidental makes it visible. Take the word father for example. Why is it **patre** and not some other word? It’s because it serves the key role in words related to it that we all know.

            <dl class="dl-horizontal">
              <dt>patre </dt> <dd>(<strong>patr</strong>·e) father</dd>
              <dt>patria </dt><dd>(<strong>patr</strong>·ia) homeland (fatherland)</dd>
              <dt>expatriate </dt><dd>(ex·<strong>patr</strong>·ia·t·e) expatriate (ex means out, from, or out from)</dd>
              <dt>patriarch </dt><dd>(<strong>patr</strong>·i·arch) patriarch</dd>
              <dt>patriot </dt><dd>(<strong>patr</strong>·i·ot) patriot</dd>
              <dt>patriotisme </dt><dd>(<strong>patr</strong>·i·ot·isme) patriotism</dd>
              <dt>repatriation </dt><dd>(re·<strong>patr</strong>·i·a·t·ion) repatriation</dd>
            </dl>

Now in other languages this is hidden: patre is père in French (the t is gone), padre in Spanish. But when we get to the derived terms, we see the **t** come back. This is the ingrained common root that Occidental uses.

When you know Occidental, the common roots simply become visible in a way excelled by maybe only Latin. Have a look over the following list and see just how clear the vocabulary becomes when expressed in Occidental.

            <dl class="dl-horizontal">
              <dt>Intervalle</dt> <dd>(interval), formed from <strong>inter</strong> (between) and <strong>valle</strong> (mound, bulwark). Literal meaning: a "between-walls”.</dd>
              <dt>Ínevitabil</dt> <dd>(inevitable), formed from <strong>ín</strong> (reverses the meaning), <strong>evitar</strong> (to evade) → evit·abil. Literal meaning: “un-evade-able”.</dd>
              <dt>burgeonant</dt> <dd>(burgeoning): a <strong>burgeon</strong> is a bud in Occidental. Then verbalized as <strong>burgeonar</strong> → burgeona·nt</dd>
              <dt>vernal</dt> <dd>(vernal): Think of the vernal equinox, the day in March when day and night are of equal length and spring officially begins. In Occidental <strong>verne</strong> means spring</dd>
              <dt>radicalisme</dt> <dd>(radicalism): the word <strong>radica</strong> means root. A radical is someone “rooted” in an ideology.</dd>
              <dt>seculari</dt> <dd>(secular): a <strong>secul</strong> is a century in Occidental. -<strong>ari</strong> turns it into an adjective meaning something of this era (something that is a product of its time).</dd>
              <dt>nomination</dt> <dd>(nomination): a <strong>nómine</strong> is a name. This one is easy: a nomination is literally a “naming”.</dd>
            
          </dl>
