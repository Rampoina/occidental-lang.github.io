## Using the Template to create your own website

You can now generate your own website, using this one as a template. 

Just follow this link to begin: https://github.com/occidental-lang/occidental-lang.github.io/generate

**Note:** You should name your generated project something like `accountOrOrganizationName.github.io` if you want it to be the main website for your organization / account.

Things you'll want to do after generating from this template:

1. Delete the following files from the top level directory

- android-chrome-192x192.png
- apple-touch-icon.png
- browserconfig.xml
- CNAME
- favicon-16x16.png
- favicon-32x32.png
- favicon.ico
- mstile-150x150.png
- safari-pinned-tab.svg
- site.webmanifest

2. Generate your own Favicon at https://realfavicongenerator.net/ and dump the files into the top level directory of your project

3. Edit the README and index.html files for your own information. This will require web programming abilities, but you can play around and get the hang of it!

- Delete the google tag from index.html
- Change instances of "occidental" to whatever your website is about
